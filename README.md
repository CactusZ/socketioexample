# Socket.io chat example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example made with socket.io.
As the basis the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide source code was used.

Additional improvements (from Homework section):
1) Online user list
2) "User is typing" functionality
3) System notifications when user logins/disconnects
4) Nickname support
5) Donâ€™t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.


To install application execute
