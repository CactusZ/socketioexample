# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat exampleused for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

Additional improvements (from Homework section):
1) Online user list
2) "User is typing" functionality
3) System notifications when user logins/disconnects
4) Nickname support
5) Donâ€™t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.

To run application write 
` node index.js ` and connect to `localhost:3000` via browser.
